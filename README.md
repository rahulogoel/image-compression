# Image Compression

In this notebook I had used K-Means Clustering which is an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm that groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

Here I had used .png over .jpeg as jpeg uses lossy compression whereas png uses lossless compression which is needed here to compare actual compression between different clusters. [Read More here](https://www.adobe.com/in/creativecloud/file-types/image/comparison/jpeg-vs-png.html)

## Output

 Original Image       |  Compressed Image of 128 colors  |Compressed Image of 64 colors
-------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------
![Original Image](https://github.com/rahulogoel/image-compression/blob/main/output/macaw_bird_orig.png) | ![Compressed Image of 128 colors](https://github.com/rahulogoel/image-compression/blob/main/output/macaw_bird_128.png) | ![Compressed Image of 64 colors](https://github.com/rahulogoel/image-compression/blob/main/output/macaw_bird_64.png)

Here we can clearly see the difference between size of the original image and the compressed ones.
